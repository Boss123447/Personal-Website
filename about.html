        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Adalberto Gonzalez-Mendoza. I'm currently and upcoming graduate at the
            University of Washington, majoring in Computer Science. When I first arrived at UW
            I had no prior coding experience besides the middle school scratch projects, now I've
            become and developed into a strong programmer with an interest in AI and ML.</p>
